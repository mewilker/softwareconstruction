Curl (technically `cURL`) is essentially a command line web browser. It allows you to see, debug, and execute HTTP requests from the command line console window of any operating system. This makes Curl a valuable tool for any software engineer.

The most basic syntax of curl is to simply provide a URL to the Curl application.

```sh
‚ûú  curl byu.edu

<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<html><head>
<title>301 Moved Permanently</title>
</head><body>
<h1>Moved Permanently</h1>
<p>The document has moved <a href="https://www.byu.edu/">here</a>.</p>
</body></html>
```

This will return the HTML page located at the URL. You can see the details of the HTTP connection and request by including the `-v` parameter. This is helpful for debugging HTTP headers and security interactions.

```sh
‚ûú curl -v byu.edu

* Connected to byu.edu (128.187.16.184) port 80 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: byu.edu
> User-Agent: curl/7.87.0
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
< Date: Thu, 03 Aug 2023 16:52:23 GMT
< Server: Apache/2.5.37 (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) OpenSSL/1.1.1k

< Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
<
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML 2.0//EN">
<html><head>
...
```

If you want to make a Curl request that explicitly provides the HTTP method, headers, or body, you can use the following syntax.

| Purpose | Syntax    | Example                            |
| ------- | --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Method  | -X method | -X PUT                             |
| Header  | -H header | -H "content-type:application/json" |
| Body    | -d body   | -d '{"name":"berners-lee"}'        |

Putting this all together in a single request would look like the following if you were trying to create a new chess game using a server running locally.

```sh
‚ûú curl -X POST localhost:8080/game -d '{ "gameName": "speed"}' -H "Authorization:607b0857"
```

Take some time to get familiar with Curl. You can use it to test your server, programmatically make batch requests, or to probe and debug how other web services work.

> [!NOTE] Note that when running under Windows Powershell `curl` is mapped to the `Invoke-WebRequest` command. You don't want to use that. Instead type `curl.exe` to actually access Curl.
