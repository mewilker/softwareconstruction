# Fall 2025 Schedule - Dr. Rodham

This schedule applies to all of Dr. Rodham's CS 240 sections (blended/in-person and online). For blended/in-person sections, the "Video Lecture Topics" column lists lecture topics that will not be covered in class. Students will need to watch the videos on these topics. Entries in this column may be updated throughout the semester depending on how far we get in in-class lectures.

Students in online sections should watch all videos for all topics, including those listed under "Discussion Topics" and any additional topics listed under "Video Lecture Topics".
